#' AGA (0), SGA 3-10% (1) or SGA <3% (2), given a data frame / tibble/ or
#' data.table that has (at least) columns named 'gestage','weight',and 'sex'.

#' There are some requirements: (1) the 'gestage' column must not be negative, and will
#' be assumed to be expressed in weeks (fractional weeks are allowed); (2) the
#' 'sex' column can only contain values 1,2 or NA. Values equal to 1 will be
#' assumed to indicate males, while values equal to 2 will be assumed to indicate
#' females; (3) all three required variables must be numeric; (4) the 'weight'
#' variable will be assumed to be in grams. Multiply by 1000 if your weights
#' are in kilograms.

#' @param include_outliers (logical, default = FALSE); set to true if individuals
#' with non-missing gestational age value below the minimum value (24) or above
#' the maximum value (default 43) should be assumed to have gestage set to those
#' bounds
